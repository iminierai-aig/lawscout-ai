## Temporary Troubleshooting Files

**CRITICAL**: When creating any temporary files during troubleshooting, debugging, or development sessions, ALWAYS place them in the `temp/` directory.

### Files that MUST go in `temp/`:
- Debug scripts (e.g., `debug_api.py`, `test_connection.sh`)
- Temporary test files (e.g., `test_output.json`, `temp_data.csv`)
- Troubleshooting notes (e.g., `troubleshoot_cors.md`, `debug_logs.txt`)
- One-off test scripts
- Temporary data files
- Any files created for debugging that are not part of the permanent codebase

### Rules:
1. **NEVER** create temporary troubleshooting files in the project root
2. **NEVER** create temporary files in permanent directories (like `scripts/`, `tests/`, etc.) unless they are permanent additions
3. **ALWAYS** use `temp/` for any file that is:
   - Created to debug an issue
   - A one-time test script
   - Temporary output or data
   - Not intended to be committed to git

### Examples:
- ✅ `temp/debug_cors_issue.py` - Correct
- ✅ `temp/test_api_response.json` - Correct
- ✅ `temp/troubleshoot_deployment.md` - Correct
- ❌ `debug_cors_issue.py` (in root) - Wrong
- ❌ `scripts/test_temp.sh` - Wrong (unless it's permanent)

### Note:
The `temp/` directory is excluded from git (in `.gitignore`), so files placed there will not be committed or pushed to the repository.
